## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this Repository onto your Desktop_
* _Open up the HTML file in the web browser of your choosing_

## Known Bugs

_I'm still finding my way, as far as Javascript, thus there might be a few bugs crawling around in this one. C'est la vie._

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issues, email me, and I will gladly respond._

## Technologies Used

_I used Bootstrap to create this responsive layout, as well as many of Bootstrap's features (e.g., classes, etc.). Other than that, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript -something I've learned a little about, this week. I also used the Terminal, Git, and GitHub. This was all done on my personal MacBook Air (i.e., my boyfriend)._
