#### By _**Jenna Cooper**_

## Description

_This is a "track suggester". The purpose of it is to help someone figure out which "track" they should take at Epicodus. One may do so by answering the questions and clicking the submit button._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this Repository onto your Desktop_
* _Open it up, via your favorite browser (...I like Firefox, but apparently it's not one of the cool kids...)._
* _Have a lovely day_


## Known Bugs

I'm not sure there's any sort of bug; but, if there is, I hope it's a ladybug.

## Support and contact details

_If you have any issues, email me, and I will gladly respond._

## Technologies Used

_I used Bootstrap to create this responsive layout, as well as many of Bootstrap's features (e.g., classes, etc.). Other than that, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript -something I've learned a little about, this week. I also used the Terminal, Git, and GitHub. This was all done on my personal MacBook Air (i.e., my boyfriend)._
